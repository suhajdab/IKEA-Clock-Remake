# IKEA-Clock-Remake
A fun pet project developing an HTML version of the [IKEA Clock redesign by Gabriel Lavall√©e](https://www.designspiration.com/save/1294284022154/)

Loved the design and thus decided to create a functional version in html meanwhile also experimenting with css animations. 

The clock is adjusted to current time on load by javascript using negative `animationDelay`. Updating is then done purely by css using `animation-duration` and `animation-timing-function: steps()`. It was also the first attempt at using `Pug` to generate the html and `Sass` to generate the css.

Originally developed on [codepen](https://codepen.io/suhajdab/pen/Gqhcg) Nov 4, 2013.
